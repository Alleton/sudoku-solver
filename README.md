=============

Java algorithm to solve 9*9 sudokus....

Written during a week end in the countryside with JF Alleton

Tested on SuperToto, Le Monde and some "Extreme" sudokus 

Just edit the main file (com.legallic.sudoku.SudokuSolverMain) to add your Sudoku matrix and then launch.

Still a lot of things to do ... :
* Create a generic method to browse matrix rows / columns / squares
* Allow to create n-sized matrix
* Manage all exceptions
* More comments
* More heuristics ?
* Scan and OCR solver
* Definitively Choose between French and English...    

* new version 1.1 13/10/2014
* Use a file (.sud ) to initialize matrix
* Use propertie file to choose .sud file
